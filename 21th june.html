Training Day11 Report
(21 June 2024)


BOOTSTRAP:
Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a powerful, feature- packed frontend toolkit. Build anything—from prototype to production—in minutes.

Quick start:

1.	Create a new index.html file in your project root. Include the <meta name="viewport"> tag as well for proper responsive behavior in mobile devices.


OUTPUT: Welcome!
2.	Include Bootstrap’s CSS and JS. Place the <link> tag in the <head> for our CSS, and the <script> tag for our JavaScript bundle (including Popper for positioning dropdowns, poppers, and tooltips) before the closing </body>. Learn more about our CDN links.

 



















OUTPUT: Hello, world!
Grid system: Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

Example
Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth explanation for how the grid system comes together.

 
 
OUTPUT:


Grid options
Bootstrap’s grid system can adapt across all six default breakpoints, and any breakpoints you customize. The six default grid tiers are as follows:

•	Extra small (xs)
•	Small (sm)
•	Medium (md)
•	Large (lg)
•	Extra large (xl)
•	Extra extra large (xxl)

Buttons:
Base class
Bootstrap has a base .btn class that sets up basic styles such as padding and content alignment. By default, .btn controls have a transparent border and background color, and lack any explicit focus and hover styles.
<button type="button" class="btn">Base class</button>
 
Variants:
Bootstrap includes several button variants, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-success">Success</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Danger</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">Warning</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Info</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-light">Light</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-dark">Dark</button>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-link">Link</button>
 
 
OUTPUT:


Button tags
The .btn classes are designed to be used with the <button> element. However, you can also use these classes on <a> or <input> elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).

When using button classes on <a> elements that are used to trigger in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given a role="button" to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers

<a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Link</a>

<button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Button</button>

<input class="btn btn-primary" type="button" value="Input">

<input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" value="Submit">

<input class="btn btn-primary" type="reset" value="Reset">

Outline buttons
In need of a button, but not the hefty background colors they bring? Replace the default modifier classes with the .btn-outline-* ones to remove all background images and colors on any button.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Secondary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-success">Success</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-danger">Danger</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-warning">Warning</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Info</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-light">Light</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-dark">Dark</button>

Sizes
Fancy larger or smaller buttons? Add .btn-lg or .btn-sm for additional sizes.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Large button</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-lg">Large button</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Small button</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm">Small button</button>
 
Disabled state
Make buttons look inactive by adding the disabled boolean attribute to any <button> element. Disabled buttons have pointer-events: none applied to, preventing hover and active states from triggering.

Primary button Button
Disabled buttons using the <a> element behave a bit different:

•	<a>s don’t support the disabled attribute, so you must add the .disabled class to make it visually appear disabled.
•	Some future-friendly styles are included to disable all pointer-events on anchor buttons.
•	Disabled buttons using <a> should include the aria-disabled="true" attribute to indicate the state of the element to assistive technologies.
•	Disabled buttons using <a> should not include the href attribute.

Block buttons
Create responsive stacks of full-width, “block buttons” like those in Bootstrap 4 with a mix of our display and gap utilities. By using utilities instead of button-specific classes, we have much greater control over spacing, alignment, and responsive behaviors.

Cards:

A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If you’re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.

Content types
Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more. Below are examples of what’s supported.

Body
The building block of a card is the .card-body. Use it whenever you need a padded section within a card.

<div class="card">
<div class="card-body">
This is some text within a card body.
</div>
</div>

Titles, text, and links
Card titles are used by adding .card-title to a <h*> tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other by adding .card-link to an <a> tag.
 
Subtitles are used by adding a .card-subtitle to a <h*> tag. If the .card-title and the .card- subtitle items are placed in a .card-body item, the card title and subtitle are aligned nicely.

<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
<div class="card-body">
<h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-body-secondary">Card subtitle</h6>
<p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
<a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
<a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
</div>
</div>

Images
.card-img-top and .card-img-bottom respectively set the top and bottom corners rounded to match the card’s borders. With .card-text, text can be added to the card. Text within .card- text can also be styled with the standard HTML tags.

Navbars:

 
<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
<span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
</button>
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
<ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
<li class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="#">Home</a>
</li>
<li class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link" href="#">Link</a>
</li>
<li class="nav-item dropdown">
<a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" role="button" data- bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false">
Dropdown
</a>
<ul class="dropdown-menu">
<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a></li>
<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a></li>
<li><hr class="dropdown-divider"></li>
<li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else
 
here</a></li>
 

</ul>
</li>
<li class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link disabled" aria-disabled="true">Disabled</a>
</li>
 
</ul>
<form class="d-flex" role="search">
<input class="form-control me-2" type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
<button class="btn btn-outline-success" type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
</div>
</div>
</nav>
